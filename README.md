## Introduce yourself

Hi! I'm Yardenna from Norway. I just finished my 2-year education in frontend developement. However, my passion is working with user experience design. I've always loved viewing and creating art and design, and used to draw and paint a lot. When my brother became an interaction designer and introduced me to the field, I realised for the first time what I want to do for a living. I am passionate about creating user-friendly solutions that everyone can understand, as I find it frustrating when poor design prevents people from knowing what to do and how to do it, and I value usability, clarity and accessibility. Enrolling in this course is very exciting, as it allows me to finally start learning about UX design in depth.

# Module 1 — Foundations of User Experience Design

## The basics of user experience design

**User experience:** How a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product.

**Product:** A good, service, or feature.

For a user to have a good experience, the product needs to be
- Usable
- Equitable
- Enjoyable
- Useful

UX is about improving usability, or making something esasier to use. This means that the design, structure and purpose of the product is clear to everyone.
UX designers need to think about every person who uses the product. This might include people with disabilities, or people with very different life experiences from your own.

Being equitable means your designs are useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds.

UX is also about making things enjoyable to use, which creates a positive connection between the user and the product. UX designers foster that positive connection, by taking a user's thoughts and feelings into account when making products.
To know how users feel, we have to collect evidence on how they're experiencing that product in real time, and ask them about it too.

As humans, we want products that are useful, meaning they solve our problems. For example: If you're lost, a map app, telling you how to get home, is useful. But if the app can't find your current location, it's not so useful anymore.

When people like a product, they use that product a lot, and they reccommend it to their friends. And more people using the product, means better business for the company. Plus, when people have a good experience with a product, they're more likely to have a positive opinion of the company that made it. A win-win for the user and the business.

## Jobs in the field of user experience

UX designers tend to be curious about people and like thinking about how people's minds work. They also enjoy figuring out how people use products and how to make those products easier to use. UX designers are empathetic too. Empathy is the ability to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation, and it's a major part of UX.

**Interaction designers:** Focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions. They figure out how to connect the users' needs and the business's goals with what's actually feasible to build.
An interaction designer's work answers questions like: What should happen if a user taps on this button? How do we make this action easier for users to complete? And, how are the design elements within the website laid out? Interaction designers focus less on how the product looks and instead strive to make the product easy to navigate and simple for users to interact with.

**Visual designers:** Focus on how a product or technology looks. They might be responsible for designing logos, illustrations, or icons. They may also decide font color and size, or work on product layouts.
The role of a visual designer is to answer questions like: What kind of visual style should icons have, in order to fit the product's branding? Or, which color and font should we use for this button? The goal of a visual designer is to delight users with designs that inspire, engage, and excite them.

**Motion designers:** Think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product and how to create smooth transitions between pages on an app or a website.
A motion designer’s work answers questions like: How should an app transition between pages? How do we show the connection between these actions? And, what’s an engaging animation that will help tell our story? Motion designers focus on design elements that move, rather than traditional static designs.

**Graphic designers:** Create visuals that tell a story or message. Graphic designers usually work on the appearance of a physical product, like an invitation or a poster, while UX designers focus on how users interact with the product.

**UX researchers:** Conduct the studies or interviews that help us learn how people use a product. UX researchers often identify pain points that users are experiencing and explore how products can help solve those problems. They also explore the usability of existing products, by asking users to complete tasks in an app or website, for example.
UX researchers answer questions like: What problems are users facing? Is the design of this product easy to use? And, would people be interested in this new design feature? The goal of UX researchers is often to understand how a product can provide a solution to a real problem users are having.

**UX writers:** Think about how to make the language within a product clearer to make the user experience more intuitive. This could include writing labels for buttons or adjusting the tone to be formal or friendly.
UX writers focus on answering questions like: What words should be used to communicate this idea clearly? Should the tone for this app be friendly or technical? And, what should the language on this button label say? UX writers often become subject matter experts in order to present content that’s easy to understand for all users. 

**Production designers:** (Often act as a bridge between interaction designers and engineers.) They make sure the first and final designs match in the finished product materials and that the assets are ready to be handed off to the engineering team. The assets are everything from text and images to the design specifications, like font style, color, size, and spacing.

**UX engineers:** (One of the groups that UX designers work with most frequently.) Translate the design's intent into a functioning experience, like a website or an app.
UX engineers answer questions like: How do we implement each interaction? How do we build this design in a way that stays true to its original intent? And, how might we explore alternatives to determine the best user experience? UX engineers synthesize design and development, bringing product concepts to life. 

**UX program managers:** Ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish. This might include setting up goals and writing project plans.
UX program managers answer questions like: What are the overall goals for this project, and what’s the plan to achieve them? And, how can we create and improve processes within the team? UX program managers work across departments to make sure that UX is involved throughout a project lifecycle.

## Most common UX tools 

Sketch, Freehand, and Zeplin

- Work well with very large teams that may struggle to adopt new tools¨
- Paired most commonly with another of these tools
- Do not require WiFi, enabling offline design work
- Do not afford real-time collaboration, prototyping, or design to development collaborative activities

Adobe XD

- Works well with teams that already use Adobe’s Suite
- Rounds out Adobe’s suite of products with one that is entirely built for digital and UX design work
- Syncs to Cloud rather than using actual real-time collaboration and can be used offline

Figma

- Is excellent for most designers and contexts
- Includes FigJam access, a whiteboard for brainstorming, diagramming, and strategizing
- Requires WiFi connection
- Is a digital-first, remote-friendly, all-in-one tool, allowing for easier sharing, designing, collaboration, and reviewing in our ever-changing, more virtual workspace

## The product development life cycle

**Product development lifecycle:** The process used to take a product from an idea to reality.

There are five stages in the product development lifecycle:

- **Brainstorm:** An active discovery stage that's all about generating ideas about the user and potential needs or challenges the user might have.
- **Define:** Using the insights from the brainstorm stage and starting to narrow the focus.
- **Design:** Implementing insights into new designs using various tools.
- **Test:** Evaluating the product design based on the feedback of potential users.
- **Launch:** Sharing a finished version of the product with the public.
